# hybrid-gnn-routing
Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) model integrated with classical Dijkstra and A* algorithms for efficient and accurate path prediction on grid-based graphs.  This project combines learning-based routing with traditional search methods to achieve faster inference while maintaining optimal path costs.
